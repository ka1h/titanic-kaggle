# The Titanic Kaggle Competition

This repo contains a personal exercise for the ![Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/). The goal is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing the passenger such as his age, his sex, or his ticket class on the boat.

The ![notebook](titanic-competition.ipynb) starts off with an exploratory data analysis (EDA), follows up with feature engineering and finally presents the predictive model as possible solution for the challenge.

## Note
This is an early attempt as a machine learning practitioner. There is a high chance that a more efficient way of coding is available. This will be work in progress for some time.
